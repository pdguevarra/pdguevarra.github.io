<h1>Hello Computer Science World!</h1>

<p>Hello. My name is Patricia Guevarra and this is my homepage and portfolio! I am a Computer Science Major at California State University, Fullerton. </p>

<h2>CPSC 120-05 LABS</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lab 01</strong>: Lab 01 was the start of it all. This was the first lab we coded with a simple "Hello World." output. It remains one of my favorite labs due to it bringing me the memory of the first code that I was able to do on my own even thought it was with my partner. This lab started it all and I continue to love the simplicity of it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lab 06</strong>: Lab 06 was a favorite due to learning how to filter vectors. I also liked writing a code that was able to guess multiples of 2 and it was amazing to see how a computer is able to analyze this with my code. Although it was kind of confusing, this was a fun one to do.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lab 08</strong>: Part 2 of Lab 08 was also my favorite as it made me write a code to help determine if a number was prime or not. It has also helped me work on loops which I still struggle on but am working very hard to understand. Making effective loops is my new goal in future classes! </p></li>
</ol>
